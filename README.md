# Solitaire Encryption Algorithm

It is a simplified implementation of the solitaire encryption algorithm by Bruce Schneier

## How it works

The program inputs a message from the user and encrypts it using a keystream generated through multiple steps. It mainly uses the concept of arrays in its development alongwith repetitive and decision structure methods.

## Steps
  1) Generates the Keystream Value
  2) Encoding using the algorithm
  3) Decoding the encoded message
